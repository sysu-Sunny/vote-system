vote-system
===========

This project provides a convenient vote system for 2014 election of MIAC. It has no server supports but just a simple front-end web page. Yeah, it's a Single Page Application!! 

This project is in active development, but we strongly recommend you to use it, actually. It's fancy.

## Usage
It is incredibly easy to use!! Follow the instructions below:

### step 1:

    git clone <git-repo-uri>
    cd vote-system
    explore .

### step 2:

Double click the `index.html`, you would see the whole application in your browser. We don't provide any tips for using it, for it is super easy to use; even idiots can figure how to use it without any learnings.
